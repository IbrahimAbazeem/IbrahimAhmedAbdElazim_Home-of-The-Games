## 🌟 Highlighted Animations and Transitions

The project emphasizes visually appealing animations and transitions to create a polished and professional user experience. Here are some key features:

### 1. **Kinetic Effects**
   - The `kinetic` class in the header and main sections uses CSS animations to create fluid, particle-like motion, giving the site a dynamic feel.
   - These effects are lightweight and optimized for performance, ensuring smooth rendering across devices.

### 2. **Smoke Animation**
   - A `smokeCanvas` element in the navigation uses JavaScript and Canvas API to generate a mesmerizing smoke-like animation, adding a modern and playful touch to the navigation bar.

### 3. **Button Transitions**
   - Buttons (e.g., "Let's play Games!", navigation links) feature hover and click animations with CSS transitions, including scaling, color changes, and shadow effects for a responsive feel.
   - The hamburger menu toggle (open/close buttons) includes smooth rotations and transitions for an intuitive user experience.

### 4. **Loading Text Animation**
   - The `loading-text` element animates from "0%" to "100%" with a smooth, incremental effect, building excitement before the user interacts with the games.

### 5. **Dark Mode Toggle**
   - The dark mode toggle button features a subtle animation when clicked, smoothly transitioning the site’s color scheme for a seamless user experience.
